Enrolling on courses::
All visitors to the MERN Classroom application will have the option to sign in and
then enroll on any of the published courses
--Enrolling on a course would give them access to the lesson details and would allow them to go through the lessons
systematically to complete the course.

Lecture 1:
Defining an Enrollment model::
--We will define an Enrollment schema and model in order to store the details of each
enrollment in the application
--It will have fields to store the reference to the course
being enrolled in and the user who is enrolling as a student. It will also store an array
corresponding to the lessons in the associated course, which will store the completion
status of each of the lessons for this student.
--Additionally, we will store three
timestamp values; the first value will signify when the student enrolled, the second
value will indicate the last time that they completed a lesson or updated the
enrollment, and finally, when they completed the course.

Lecture 2:
The create Enrollment API
--When a user chooses to enroll in a course, we will create a new enrollment and store
it in the backend.

--A POST request received at this route will first check whether the
user is authenticated, and then check whether they are already enrolled on this
course, before creating a new enrollment for this user in this course.

--The findEnrollment controller method will query the Enrollments collection in
the database in order to check whether there is already an enrollment with the given
course ID and user ID.

--If a matching result is returned from the query, then the resulting enrollment will be
sent back in the response, otherwise, the create controller method will be invoked to
create a new enrollment.
