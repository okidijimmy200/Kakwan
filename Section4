Enrolling on courses::
All visitors to the MERN Classroom application will have the option to sign in and
then enroll on any of the published courses
--Enrolling on a course would give them access to the lesson details and would allow them to go through the lessons
systematically to complete the course.

Lecture 1:
Defining an Enrollment model::
--We will define an Enrollment schema and model in order to store the details of each
enrollment in the application
--It will have fields to store the reference to the course
being enrolled in and the user who is enrolling as a student. It will also store an array
corresponding to the lessons in the associated course, which will store the completion
status of each of the lessons for this student.
--Additionally, we will store three
timestamp values; the first value will signify when the student enrolled, the second
value will indicate the last time that they completed a lesson or updated the
enrollment, and finally, when they completed the course.
