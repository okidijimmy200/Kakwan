Lecture 1:
Fetching the create API in the view::
--the create method will be used in the new course form view to submit the user-entered
course details to the backend to create a new course in the database

The NewCourse component::
--In order to allow educators to create new courses, we will add a React component
that contains a form to the frontend of the application.

--The form will contain an option to upload the course image, input fields for entering
the course Name, Description, and Category; and the SUBMIT button, which will
save the details that have been entered into the database.

--The NewCourse component can only be viewed by a signed-in user who is also an
educator. So, we will add a PrivateRoute to the MainRouter component, which
will render this form only for authorized users at /teach/course/new.
