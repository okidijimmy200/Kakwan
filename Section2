Lecture 1:
Fetching the create API in the view::
--the create method will be used in the new course form view to submit the user-entered
course details to the backend to create a new course in the database

The NewCourse component::
--In order to allow educators to create new courses, we will add a React component
that contains a form to the frontend of the application.

--The form will contain an option to upload the course image, input fields for entering
the course Name, Description, and Category; and the SUBMIT button, which will
save the details that have been entered into the database.

--The NewCourse component can only be viewed by a signed-in user who is also an
educator. So, we will add a PrivateRoute to the MainRouter component, which
will render this form only for authorized users at /teach/course/new.

Lecture 2:
Listing courses by educator
---Authorized educators will be able to see a list of the courses that they have created on
the platform.

The list course API::
---To process the :userId param in the route and retrieve the associated user from the
database, we will utilize the userByID method in our user controller

The MyCourses component::
--In the MyCourses component, we will render the list of courses in a Material-UI
List, after fetching the data from the server using the listByInstructor API. This
component, as pictured in the following image, will function as the educator's
dashboard, where their courses are listed and they have an option to add new
courses:
