Lecture 1:
Editing a course::
--Once a course has been added by an educator and there are more updates to be
incorporated, the educator will be able to edit the details of the course as its
instructor. Editing a course includes the ability to update its lessons, as well

Updating the course API::
--In the backend, we will need an API that allows an existing course to be updated if
the user who is making the request is the authorized instructor of the given course.

--A PUT request that is received at the /api/courses/:courseId route first checks if
the signed-in user is the instructor of the course that is associated with the courseId
provided in the URL. If the user is found to be authorized, the update controller is
invoked

The EditCourse component::
--we will add a view for editing a course and it will have two sections.
The first part will let the user change the course details, including the name, category,
description, and image; and the second part will allow the modification of the lessons
for the course.

--In order to load EditCourse in the frontend of the application, we need to declare a
frontend route for it. This component can only be viewed by a signed-in user who is
also the instructor of the course. So, we will add a PrivateRoute in
the MainRouter component, which will render this view only for authorized users
at /teach/course/edit/:courseId

Updating lessons::
--In order to allow instructors to update the lessons that they have added to a course,
we will add the following section in the EditCourse component, which will allow
the user to edit the lesson details, rearrange the order of the lessons, and delete a
lesson
--The implementation of these lesson update features will mostly rely on array
manipulation techniques.

Editing lesson details::
--Users will be able to edit the details of each field in a lesson in the EditCourse
component
--each item in the list of lessons will contain three
TextFields for each of the fields in a lesson and will be prepopulated with the
existing values of the fields

Moving the lessons to rearrange the order::
--While updating lessons, the user will also be able to reorder each lesson on the list.
There will be an up arrow button for each lesson, except for the very first lesson. This
button will be added to each lesson item in the view

Deleting a lesson::
--each item rendered in the lessons list will have a delete
option. The Delete button will be added in the view to each list item
